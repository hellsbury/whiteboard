"Features"
- Card labels under description
- Dark mode
- Trash bin? (If I accidentally delete a card)
- Close the card edit modal (Currently the only way to leave is to save. Probably not a big deal but may be nice)
- Maybe an "Are you sure you wanna delete this?" for *cards*
- Maybe an "Are you sure you wanna delete this?" for *columns*
